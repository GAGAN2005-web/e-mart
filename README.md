# How It Works
Functional Flow
1. Product Listing:
All products are fetched or stored locally and displayed dynamically using the map() function.

2. Add to Cart:
When the user clicks Add to Cart, the selected product is stored in the cart state (using useState or Context API).

3. Cart Management:
The cart displays all added products, their quantities, and total price.
Users can remove items or update quantity.

4. Routing:
React Router is used to navigate between Home, Products, and Cart pages without reloading.
